# Tic Tac Toe Solved

Tic Tac Toe is a very small game, making it very easy to solve. This program will always play the best moves, but may not always play moves that lead to the fastest victory. It utilizes the minimax algorithm. Due to its simple nature, not many optimizations are used, such as avoiding making a new tree from an already evaluated position.

## How to Run

To run, run `make` to compile the source code. Then, run the output binary file `main` by running `./main`.
