# Tic Tac Toe Solved

Tic Tac Toe is a very small game, making it very easy to solve. This program will always play the best moves, but may not always play moves that lead to the fastest victory. It utilizes the minimax algorithm. It contains a table including all visited positions so that equal positions do not have their own tree, greatly shortening the tree length and overall time taken to solve the game.

## How to Run

To run, run `make` to compile the source code. Then, run the output binary file `main` by running `./main`.
